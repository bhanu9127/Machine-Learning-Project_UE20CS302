About Project:
Customer churn prediction is a process in business analytics and data science that involves identifying and predicting which customers are likely to stop using a product or service. In this context, churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a business, leading to decreased revenue and market share. Churn prediction aims to proactively address the issue by identifying potential churners and taking steps to retain them before they actually leave.
